    <p> Fluffy Is a Pomeranian who was groomed on 04/15/2013. He has a "lion clip." He was a wonderful client who put up with me better than I ever would have believed. It would be nice to have a way to remember the details of his visit.</p> 
    <p>This App will allow me to keep track of the pets I groom. I can also keep track of any notes on the pets and the owners. Eventually I wil be able to add a before and after picture as well. To add a pet, click the button!</p>
